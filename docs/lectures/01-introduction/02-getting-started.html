<p>COSC1315, or “Fundamentals of Programming”, is designed how you how to think
in a clear and logical way, so you can get a simple-minded machine to to the
hard work for you. You (the human) are far smarter than the computer. In fact
the computer’s sole claim to fame is its ability to do extremely simple
things incredibly fast!</p>
<p>You can be the master of this machine, with a little practice.</p>

<h2>Problem Solving<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-solving" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will explore problem solving techniques, and spend time working on our
thinking process. In order to use a computer to do your work, you have to be
very precise in how you explain things. The machine cannot use “common sense”
to fill in the missing details. For most humans, you are not used to that kind
of precision. We all assume others just know” what we mean, even if that if
often not true at all.</p>
<p>We need to analyze our problems, find a way to solve them, and then express
that solution process in a very clear manner if we ever hope to get a dumb
machine to do that work for us.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="course-textbook">
<h2>Course Textbook<a class="headerlink" href="#course-textbook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We are using a custom edition of two books for this course. The first part is
designed to teach you how to think through problems, and not how to program
using a modern programming language.</p>
<p>We will use something called “pseudo-code”, which is much like structured
English text, but short and crisp, to write down our solution ideas! We are
focusing on the solution steps when we write this “pseudo-code” now worrying
about explaining what is going on any more than necessary.</p>
<p>The first part of the book also shows a diagramming technique called “flow
charting” as a way to express your solution process.  That technique is very
old, and works reasonable well using pencil and paper, but who uses those
things anymore. We do not have a good computer tool to produce those diagrams,
so I am not going to require that you use “flow charts” in our class. Instead
you can fire up an editor and generate “pseudo-code”!</p>
<p>The second part of the custom text is an introduction to C++, one of the most
popular, and powerful, programming tools available. We will keep this part
simple, since the goal is to introduce you to programming, not turn you into
masters of that craft.</p>
<p>We will also use a tool called <a class="reference external" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> in our early assignments, to introduce
you to solving a few basic problems in a fun environment. We are not using
Scratch for playing games, although many folks do exactly that. Instead, we
will use it to explore the basic tools we use in solving problems. The problems
will be simple, and Scratch is fun to work with. Unfortunately, it is not a
real programming language tool, so later in the course we will switch to C++
and give you a basic look at that programming tool!</p>

<div class="section" id="first-week-work">
<h2>First Week Work<a class="headerlink" href="#first-week-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This first week is an introduction. You should read the syllabus and the course
introduction (this page) completely. Then you should work through setting up
your personal machine so you can do the assignments. If you have any problems
getting set up, contact me immediately and we will figure out a solution. In
many cases, bringing your (hopefully portable) system in to my office will
solve things.</p>

<p>The computer does not really know how to solve our problems, we need to figure
that out. So, we have two important things to deal with here. First, we have to
figure out how to solve our problems. Actually we need to learn how to figure
out how to solve problems - which is something else entirely!  Then we will
apply those methods to real problems and figure out how to solve them. Second,
we need to figure out how to explain to the computer what we want it to do to
solve our problem.</p>

<p>Well, actually, many people think that learning about computer programming is
just a waste of their time! They would rather just buy a commercial computer
program that does the work they need done and be done with it.  That is fine
for a lot of the problems we want computers to work on for us.  But there comes
a time when no readily available computer program will do what you want done -
so you are stuck! You (or someone you can convince to do this for you - usually
after a transfer of cash) need to create a new computer program that will do
your new job. You are the person needing the work done, you are the <cite>domain
expert</cite> (we hope), and we hope you can figure out how to solve your problem
clearly enough to either create the program yourself, or explain the process to
the person who will. Learning how to do all of this is what this course is all
about. The skills you will learn will help you in your future career - even if
you never program a computer again. You will be a better thinker, and have a
better idea of the place computers have in your life and career.</p>

<h2>My own path to programming<a class="headerlink" href="#my-own-path-to-programming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I never started off to be a programmer, I wanted to be an aeronautical engineer!</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../../_images/Factory1.jpg" class="align-center" src="../../_images/Factory1.jpg" />
<p>Heck, back when I first started college, computers were hidden away in large
buildings and only the chosen few were allowed to go near them.  Today, you
cannot get farther than a few feet from a computer wherever you go!</p>
<p>I had to work my way through college, since my parents could not afford to send
me to school. I entered a ‘’Cooperative Engineering Program’’ where a student
could work in the industry they wanted to work in when they graduated- learning
about that area and earning money to pay for college.  We would go to school
one term, then work the next term all through college. It ended up taking five
years to complete a four year program, but I was able to earn enough to pay my
own way through school.</p>
<p>I got a job with McDonnell Aircraft in St. Louis while they were building the
Gemini space capsules for NASA, and Phantom-II jets for the military. I got to
work at a number of exciting jobs over the years I worked there. It was an
amazing place to spend time, and it kept my interest level up so I did pretty
well in college.</p>
<p>During one term, I was working in the Flight Test Division where they tested
the Phantom jets before delivering them to the Air Force and Navy.  My job that
term was to analyze data collected during a test flight. The data was recorded
on a paper tape by an instrument driven pen (remember, computers were new back
then), and on magnetic tape.  I was given a choice.  I could spend the term
measuring squiggles on the paper tape with a ruler, record the data, then
calculate a bunch of numbers with a mechanical calculator, or learn how to
program a computer to just process the magnetic tape.  Since the first process
sounded way too boring, I chose to try the second one - and my career working
with computers was off and running.</p>
<p>I had a ball that term, actually getting to place my hands on a real computer
for the first time, and working on problems that seemed very important at the
time. I was way ahead of my class mates in learning all this stuff, and I found
it a lot of fun. I want your first exposure to programming to be just as much
fun.</p>

<p>All during my career I asked folks I worked with, or who worked for me, to make
sure they were having fun in what they did. If you do not truly enjoy the work
you do, you will not find satisfaction in that one thing that you will spend a
great deal of your waking hours working on. It better be fun!  My job is to try
to make this course fun, and teach you something very useful in the process. I
would appreciate your help in tuning the course materials so we succeed in
learning and having fun at the same time!</p>
