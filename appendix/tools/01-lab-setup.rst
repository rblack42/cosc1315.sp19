We will be using two main tools for this course:

    * Scratch_ - Graphical Programming Environment

    * C++ Compiler
        * CLion (not needed yet)

Scratch
*******

This is a fun tool developed at MIT to introduce beginners to the world of
programming. Much of the first part of this course is designed to get you
thinking about solving problems in a logical way. The text wants you to draw
old-fashioned "flow charts" to do your thinking. That is fine for some, but
terrible for others. I have decided to use a different tool to explore the
thinking process. Scratch_ is a programming tool available on all platforms
that can be a lot of fun, and has been used successfully by kids to get started
in this programming process. We will not explore all of what Scratch_ has to
offer, but instead use it to introduce concepts in a fun way. I may let you go
crazy with this thing later in the course. (I have had students build some cool
games with it for extra credit!)

..  note::

    In those assignments where the book wants you to draw a "flow chart", we
    will use something called "pseudo code" instead. This looks more like a
    real program, but it uses English sentences to write down your thoughts on
    how the program should run. That means you can use a simple text editor to
    document your thinking, and do not need to draw anything. More on that
    later.


We will use Scratch_ version 1.4 which is available as a program you can run on your
personal machine. The newer version of Scratch_ is designed to run from a web
browser, and all files are stored on an MIT server. We will not be using that
version. 

Here is a link to the MIT website where you can download the program for your
system:

    * https://scratch.mit.edu/scratch_1.4/

I will provide notes on how to use this system soon. For now, explore the MIT
website and see what folks are doing with this program.

Here is a reference guide on using Scratch:

CLion
*****

We will install this tool later in the course.

Text Editor
***********

For some of the work you will do for this class, you can use a "programmer's
editor" which produces simple text files. A very good one is Vim, or gVim_ on
the PC, and MacVim_ on Macs. Here are some notes on installing and getting
started with this tool:
